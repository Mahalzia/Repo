		Hello, my name is Mahalia and I am 27 and a student at West Hills College Lemoore. I'm from both Sacramento and Lemoore, and have been as far from Cali as a few of it's surrounding states. I have a lot of family native to the Phillippines, of which I am half Filipino descent. A lot of my friends in high school traveled to Europe, and I jump at the chance of making enough profit to make travel a thing! I do go out of town, the small town of Lemoore, and go up to the Sierra Mountains to see the Giant Redwood Forest and Lake Kaweah, as well as to the coast. I love my free time and the ability to make constant and unique changes to activities I am compatible with like kayaking, motorcycling, gaming, darts, and the gym! I love the unique art of programming, and hope I can serve you well in whichever webpage I can publish, that fits your goals.
